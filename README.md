# ARIA Token (ARI)

ARIA Token is a Solana-based cryptocurrency for the ARIA decentralized AI personal assistant ecosystem.

## Project Overview

ARIA is a decentralized AI personal assistant that leverages the open data ecosystem of Android phones to deeply analyze users' daily behaviors and needs, providing highly personalized life management, financial planning, and social interaction support. By utilizing Solana blockchain's efficiency and low cost, ARIA decentralizes the storage of users' private data and incentivizes ecosystem participation through a token economy.

## Technical Implementation

This repository contains the Solana program (smart contract) for the ARIA token. The contract is written in Rust and implements:

1. Token initialization
2. Token distribution to designated allocations
3. Standard SPL token functionality

## Development
