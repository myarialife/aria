ARIA Token is a Solana-based cryptocurrency for the ARIA decentralized AI personal assistant ecosystem.

## Project Overview

ARIA is a decentralized AI personal assistant that leverages the open data ecosystem of Android phones to deeply analyze users' daily behaviors and needs, providing highly personalized life management, financial planning, and social interaction support. By utilizing Solana blockchain's efficiency and low cost, ARIA decentralizes the storage of users' private data and incentivizes ecosystem participation through a token economy.

## Current Project Status

**Version**: v0.1.0 (Initial Release)  
**Development Stage**: Early Development  
**Next Milestone**: Phase 1 Completion - Basic Assistant and Data Framework  

ARIA Token is currently in its foundational development phase. The core token contract has been implemented on Solana, with comprehensive functionality for token management, distribution, and security. The Android application framework is under active development, with data collection and core AI capabilities as the primary focus.

## Token Details

- **Name**: ARIA Token (ARI)
- **Platform**: Solana
- **Launch Platform**: pump.fun
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 ARI
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Contract Type**: SPL Token (Solana Program Library)

### Token Distribution

- 50% User Incentives (Airdrops and Task Rewards)
- 20% Team Development and Operations
- 20% Community Governance and Ecosystem Building
- 10% Marketing and Partnerships

## Token Utility

- **Data Contribution Rewards**: Earn ARI by sharing anonymized preference data
- **Premium Feature Access**: Unlock advanced features with ARI tokens
- **Community Governance**: Vote on development priorities as a token holder
- **Ecosystem Payments**: Use ARI for Solana network fees with discounts

## V0.1.0 Key Features

### Core Contract Features
- **Token Initialization**: Implement token with 9 decimal places precision
- **Supply Management**: Control the total supply of 100 million tokens
- **Distribution Logic**: Programmatically distribute tokens according to allocation plan
- **Metadata Management**: Store and update token metadata on-chain

### Security Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementation of Admin, Minter, Freezer, and Burner roles
- **Authority Management**: Secure mechanism for authority assignment and revocation
- **Transaction Security**: Enhanced validation for critical operations

### Economy Features
- **Token Burning Mechanism**: Controlled reduction of token supply
- **Token Locking/Vesting**: Time-based token locking for team and marketing allocations
- **Custom Lock Duration**: Flexible timeframes for token release schedules

### System Features
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive transaction event tracking
- **Upgrade Mechanism**: Versioned contract upgrades with delay and cancellation options
- **pump.fun Integration**: Platform-specific configuration for initial token launch

## Technical Implementation

This repository contains the Solana program (smart contract) for the ARIA token. The contract is written in Rust and implements:

1. Token initialization
2. Token distribution to designated allocations
3. Standard SPL token functionality

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Solana CLI
- Node.js and npm (for testing)

### Building

```bash
cargo build-bpf
```

### Deployment

```bash
solana program deploy target/deploy/aria_token.so
```
